# "Corona-Virus Analysis" using MySQL

‚ñ∫ As a part of Data Analyst  Internship at Mentorness, I have been tasked to analyse Corona-Virus Dataset using MySQL.

### ùêìùêöùê¨ùê§ ùüê¬†: Corona-Virus Analysis using MySQL

### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective of the Project¬†:

- The objective of coronavirus analysis is to monitor how COVID-19 spreads and affects people by looking at data on cases, recoveries, and and deaths deaths in  differe different areas over time.

This includes:

- Monitoring the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Analyzing the geographical spread of the virus using latitude and longitude.
- Providing a time series of the pandemic's progression.
  
- This dataset can be used for various analyses, such as:

- Visualizing the spread of COVID-19 on a map.
- Identifying trends and patterns in the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- Comparing the impact of the virus in different regions.
- Modeling and forecasting the future course of the pandemic based on historical data. ‚Äã

### ‚û°Ô∏èProject Description¬†:

‚ú¶ The dataset contains a total of 78,000 rows, the data spans from 22 January 2020 to 13 June 2021. This period covers a significant part of the COVID-19 pandemic, including initial outbreaks, various waves, and the rollout of vaccines.

‚ú¶ There are 12 months of data present within the date range. This indicates that the dataset might have monthly aggregated data or data recorded over a year's span.

- The query aims to calculate the monthly average of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries from a dataset called corona_virus.

#### üí†SQL Query Breakdown:

#### 1] Extract Month and Year:

 #### ‚úÖ Syntax :
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%Y-%m-%d')) AS Month,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%Y-%m-%d')) AS Year,


STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%Y-%m-%d') : converts the Date field from a string format to a date format.

EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ...) : extracts the month from the date.

EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...) : extracts the year from the date.

The extracted month and year are aliased as Month and Year respectively.

#### 2] Calculate Averages:

#### ‚úÖ Syntax :

AVG(Confirmed) AS Avg_Confirmed,
AVG(Deaths) AS Avg_Deaths,
AVG(Recovered) AS Avg_Recovered,

AVG(Confirmed) : calculates the average number of confirmed cases and aliases it as Avg_Confirmed.

AVG(Deaths) : calculates the average number of deaths and aliases it as Avg_Deaths.

AVG(Recovered) : calculates the average number of recoveries and aliases it as Avg_Recovered.

#### 3] Specify the Data Source:

#### ‚úÖ Syntax :

FROM corona_virus

The data is being retrieved from the corona_virus table.

#### 4] Group by Month and Year:

#### ‚úÖ Syntax :
GROUP BY Month, Year;

The results are grouped by both the extracted month and year. This ensures that the averages are calculated for each month within each year.

#### 5] Result Table Explanation:
The result table shows the monthly averages for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Each row corresponds to a specific month and year combination.

Example Results Interpretation:

#### ‚û§ Row 1:

Month: January 2020
Avg_Confirmed: 4.1455
Avg_Deaths: 0.1234
Avg_Recovered: 0.0929

This means that in January 2020, the average number of confirmed cases was approximately 4.15, the average number of deaths was approximately 0.12, and the average number of recoveries was approximately 0.09.

#### ‚û§ Row 2:

Month: February 2020
Avg_Confirmed: 15.2960
Avg_Deaths: 0.5936
Avg_Recovered: 7.0320

- This indicates that in February 2020, the average number of confirmed cases was approximately 15.30, the average number of deaths was approximately 0.59, and the average number of recoveries was approximately 7.03.

str_to_date(Date, '%Y-%m-%d') converts the Date field from a string format to a date format.
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ...) extracts the year

#### 2] Calculate Maximum Values:

MAX(Confirmed) AS Max_Confirmed,
MAX(Deaths) AS Max_Deaths,
MAX(Recovered) AS Max_Recovered,
MAX(Confirmed): calculates the maximum number of confirmed cases and aliases it as Max_Confirmed.
MAX(Deaths) : calculates the maximum number of deaths and aliases it as Max_Deaths.
MAX(Recovered): calculates the maximum number of recoveries and aliases it as Max_Recovered.

#### 3] Specify the Data Source:

FROM corona_virus
The data is being retrieved from the corona_virus table.

#### 4] Group by Year:

GROUP BY Year

### ‚û°Ô∏è Overall  Insights :

#### ‚û§ Higher Confirmed Cases:
The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases. This reflects the significant impact of COVID-19 on the US, particularly during the peak periods of the pandemic.

#### ‚û§ Lowest Death Cases:
Countries like Dominica, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and Samoa have the lowest number of death cases. These countries may have managed to control the spread of the virus effectively or have smaller populations, leading to fewer deaths.

#### ‚û§ Highest Recovered Cases¬†:
The top five countries with the highest number of recovered cases are India, Brazil, the US, Turkey, and Russia. These countries likely experienced high numbers of cases overall, leading to high recovery numbers as well.

### ‚û°Ô∏è ùêíùêÆùê¶ùê¶ùêöùê´ùê≤¬†:

#### ‚û§ Pandemic Coverage :
The date range indicates that the dataset covers critical phases of the pandemic, making it valuable for trend analysis and understanding the progression and impact over time.

#### ‚û§ Geographical Impact:
The US having the highest confirmed cases is consistent with global reports of the pandemic's severe impact on the country. Conversely, the countries with the lowest death cases are small island nations, which might have implemented strict measures early on to prevent the spread of the virus.

#### ‚û§ Recovery Rates¬†:
High recovery numbers in populous countries like India, Brazil, and the US are expected given their large populations and significant numbers of confirmed cases. The high recovery rate can provide insights into healthcare response effectiveness and the overall trajectory of the pandemic in these regions.

‚ú® These insights can help in understanding the global impact of COVID-19, the effectiveness of different countries' responses, and the overall trends in confirmed, death, and recovery cases during the specified period.
